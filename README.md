# Wire-Car
Creating an animated wire car using __OpenGL__.
__Wire Car__ is a project that I developed for the __Computer Graphics__ lesson. 

# INTRODUCTION
This code creates a wire car that the user can play with steering and wheel movements. Four Tires, Cube, Axles, Steering Wheel, and Steering Column are required to create the Wire Car. In this code, the __Tires__ function creates four tires, the __DrawCube__ function creates cube, the __SteeringWheel__ function creates the steering wheel and steering column, the __Axles__ function creates axles.

The initial situation when the project is started. The tires seem to go forward. Initially, the wire car cannot be moved.<br/>

Tires rotate to the left when the __'A'__ key is pressed and to the right when the __'D'__ key is pressed.<br/>

<img src="GIFs/movement.gif" width="214" height="226">
The tires stop turning when the __'M'__ key is pressed. Turning the car forward, backward, left or right is left to the user. It can be moved forward by pressing the __'W'__ key, backward by pressing the __'S'__ key, left by pressing the __'A'__ key, and right by pressing the __'D'__ key.<br/>
