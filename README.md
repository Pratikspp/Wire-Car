# Wire-Car
Creating an animated wire car using OpenGL.
Wire Car is a project that I developed for the Computer Graphics lesson. 

# INTRODUCTION
This code creates a wire car that the user can play with steering and wheel movements. Four Tires, Cube, Axles, Steering Wheel, and Steering Column are required to create the Wire Car. In this code, the Tires function creates four tires, the DrawCube function creates cube, the SteeringWheel function creates the steering wheel and steering column, the Axles function creates axles.

<img src="GIFs/left_right.gif" width="214" height="226"> Tires rotate to the left when the 'A' key is pressed and to the right when the 'S' key is pressed.

<img src="GIFs/movement.gif" width="214" height="226"> The tires stop turning when the 'M' key is pressed. Turning the car forward, backward, left or right is left to the user. It can be moved forward by pressing the 'W' key, backward by pressing the 'D' key, left by pressing the ‘A’ key, and right by pressing the ‘S’ key.
